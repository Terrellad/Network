# Network

This was one of the projects in CS50 course that I took.
In this project I was to mimic a social media website like twitter.

I needed to create a model that stored users and their activities. 
I used a mixture of python and javascript. 
Python was handling the behind the scenes processes and Javascript was on the front end handling user inputs.
Then with this data as a particular user would signin I needed to have display the varies messages their liked, followed, and made.
All messages would be displayed on the main page. However only ten messages would be seen at a time.
To accomplish this pagination was used to create pages and separate and assign each message to the correct page.
